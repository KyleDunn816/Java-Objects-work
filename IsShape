/*
 * Grade: B-
 * 
 * You are missing purpose statements
 * 
 * Tests are nicely written.
 * 
 * public abstract class AShape implements IShape {

	protected int x; // used as a base or side-a of a shape
	protected int h; // used as a height of triangles and a height of a rhombus 
	
   This design suggests that all shapes have at least two 
   dimensions, which is not the case. A circle, for example, only
   has one dimension. Why associate two dimensions with a shape
   that only has one dimension? I do not understand what you 
   were abstracting over to end with this implementation.
 *
 * In AQuad you have:
 * 
 *   protected int other;
  
   Why is a third dimension needed for quadrilaterals? The needed 
   dimensions are:
     Square: side
     Rectangle: side1, side2
     Rhombus: side, height
 *
 * In Rhombus:
 * 
 * public double getPerimeter() {
		
		// purpose: calculates the perimeter of a rhombus using the formula perimeter = 4*a
		
		return (4*x);
	}
	
	public double getArea() {
		
		// purpose: calculates the area of a rhombus using the formula area = a*height
		
		return (x*h);
	}
	
	Why do these methods exist here? Were they not abstracted
	to AQuad?
 *
 * In ATri:
 * 
 * public ATri (int a, int b, int c, int height) {
		
		this.x = a; 
		this.s2 = b;
		this.s3 = c;
		this.h=height;
	}
	
   Is it reasonable to expect a user to provide the height of
   a triangle?
 *
 * In Circle:
 *   
 *   private double PI = 3.14;
 *   
 * Use Math.PI
 *
